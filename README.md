# blank-laravel-fortify-sanctum

This is a starter project for a stand-alone backend (for a separate SPA) build with Laravel, Fortify, Sanctum, Lighthouse graphql.

The intention is for it to be paired with a Vue3 + apollo frontend SPA.

The commit history shows the steps of adding each of these technologies to the project so you can use this repo as a starting point, or use it's history as a guide for other projects.
